- ✅ System that generates airfoils from requirements
- ✅ 10+ example generated airfoils

## Risk Mitigation

### If you fall behind:
- Skip web interface (Week 10)
- Use smaller performance dataset (3,000 vs 10,000 samples)
- Focus on core functionality over polish

### If something doesn't work:
- **Autoencoder not converging**: Reduce latent dimension, add more layers
- **XFOIL failing too much**: Use only "safe" airfoils (existing NACA)
- **Optimization not working**: Use simpler search (grid search in latent space)
- **Posterior collapse (if using VAE)**: Switch to deterministic autoencoder
