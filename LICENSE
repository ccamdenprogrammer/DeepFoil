================================================================================

DISCLAIMER FOR AERODYNAMIC APPLICATIONS:

This software generates airfoil geometries using machine learning techniques.
The generated airfoils are GEOMETRIC PROPOSALS ONLY and have NOT been validated
for aerodynamic performance or structural integrity.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE:
- DO NOT use generated airfoils in safety-critical applications without
  thorough validation by qualified aerospace engineers
- ALL generated designs MUST be validated using computational fluid dynamics
  (CFD) and/or wind tunnel testing before any real-world application
- The authors and contributors assume NO responsibility for the aerodynamic
  performance, structural integrity, or safety of generated airfoils
- Users are solely responsible for validating designs for their intended use

This software is intended for:
- Educational purposes
- Preliminary design exploration
- Research and development
- Generating candidate geometries for further analysis

This software is NOT intended for:
- Production aircraft design (without expert validation)
- Safety-critical applications (without thorough testing)
- Direct manufacturing (without engineering oversight)
- Flight-critical systems (without certification)

By using this software, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
